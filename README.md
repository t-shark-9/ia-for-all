# ðŸ¦ˆ Shark Chat - Website to VS Code Integration

This setup allows users to type in your website and have that text appear directly in your VS Code editor!

## Quick Setup Guide

### 1. Install Node.js Dependencies
```powershell
cd c:\Tjark\website
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Server
```powershell
npm start
```
The server will run on `http://localhost:8080`

### 3. Install VS Code Extension

#### Option A: Install from folder
1. Open VS Code
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
3. Type "Extensions: Install from VSIX..."
4. Navigate to `c:\Tjark\website\vscode-extension\`
5. Select the folder and install

#### Option B: Development mode
1. Open VS Code
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
3. Type "Developer: Install Extension from Location..."
4. Navigate to `c:\Tjark\website\vscode-extension\`

### 4. Start the VS Code Extension
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` in VS Code
2. Type "ðŸ¦ˆ Start Shark Chat Receiver"
3. Click the command
4. You should see "ðŸ¦ˆ Shark Chat: Connected" in the status bar

### 5. Test the Connection
1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8080`
2. You should see the connection status as "Connected to VS Code"
3. Type a message in the chat and press Enter
4. The text should appear in your VS Code editor!

## How It Works

1. **Website** (`index.html`) - Users type messages here
2. **WebSocket Server** (`server.js`) - Relays messages between website and VS Code
3. **VS Code Extension** (`vscode-extension/`) - Receives messages and inserts them into your editor

## Features

- âœ… Real-time text transmission from website to VS Code
- âœ… Connection status indicator
- âœ… Automatic reconnection
- âœ… File attachment support (sends file names as comments)
- âœ… Visual notifications
- âœ… Status bar integration in VS Code

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection Failed" in website
- Make sure the server is running (`npm start`)
- Check if port 8080 is available

### "VS Code not connected" 
- Make sure the VS Code extension is installed and started
- Check the VS Code status bar for connection status

### Port already in use
- Change the port in `server.js` (line: `const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8080;`)
- Update the WebSocket URL in `index.html` (line: `websocket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');`)

## Commands

### Server Commands
```powershell
npm start          # Start the server
npm run dev        # Start with auto-reload (if you installed nodemon)
```

### VS Code Commands
- `ðŸ¦ˆ Start Shark Chat Receiver` - Connect to the server
- `ðŸ¦ˆ Stop Shark Chat Receiver` - Disconnect from the server

## File Structure
```
c:\Tjark\website\
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html              # Main website
â”œâ”€â”€ server.js               # WebSocket server
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json            # Server dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ vscode-extension/       # VS Code extension
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json        # Extension manifest
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ extension.js        # Extension code
â””â”€â”€ README.md              # This file
```

## Next Steps

Once everything is working, you can:
- Customize the UI styling
- Add more message types (code snippets, commands, etc.)
- Deploy the server to a remote host
- Package the VS Code extension for distribution
- Add authentication/security features

Enjoy your Shark Chat! ðŸ¦ˆ
